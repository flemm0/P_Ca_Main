ANALYSIS 1 - RNAseq DGE all possible combinations by "Race" and "Tissue type":

EXAMPLE:
Race: Black, Tissue type: Malignant -VS- Race: Black, Tissue type: Non-Malignant
Race: Black, Tissue type: Malignant -VS- Race: White, Tissue type: Non-Malignant
...


Output:
1) Gene lists: p-val= 0.05, p-val= 0.01, p-val= 0.001, FDR: 10%
2) MA PLOTS - colored significant p-value
3) Volcano PLOTS - colored significant p-value
4) Pathways analysis using gene lists.
